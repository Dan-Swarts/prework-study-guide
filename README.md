# My Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This project was built to store my Software Development Bootcamp notes and to help me study the information.

- I was motivated to create this project by my need for a central, accessible place to store all my notes. I also wanted a suite of learning-enhancement tools to aid my studying.
- This project solves the problem with a web page hosted through GitHub Pages, which allows me to access it from any machine. I can also implement learning-enhancing features on this webpage as my development skills grow.
- While working on this project, I learned the basics of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and version control.

This project was made by me, Daniel Swarts, but I couldn't have done it without the guidance provided through the 
Northwestern Software Development Bootcamp and many open-source resources such as w3schools.com.
